Because we’re creating customized solutions, our first step in any project is to learn about your business and determine your objectives. Once we have a firm understanding of you needs, we define the project, formulate a solution and provide a firm quote and timeline.

For complex projects, such as software that will likely take more than a month of development, we set multiple milestones. At each milestone we give you a working version of the software, adding features at every stage. You have an opportunity to test the software and provide feedback. We’re able to make any adjustments you want to ensure the finished product performs exactly as you wish.

Communication and transparency are priorities for us so you’ll always know how your project is progressing. We’re accessible to answer your questions every step of the way.

In every project we do, we ensure:

* Quality architecture
* Scalability to accommodate future growth
* Flexibility to integrate with existing and future systems and services
* Cutting-edge security features to protect users, processes and data

Any software or app we create comes with installation and one year of ongoing support. We can also provide monthly pricing for ongoing management and maintenance.
