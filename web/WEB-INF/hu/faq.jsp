* Create an application for managing your orders
* Log the time you take on projects
* Set up email samples that you can send in one click
* Allow customers to check the status of their orders

* Set up a system that sends email or SMS payment reminders automatically

The possibilities are truly endless. We find ways to help streamline your critical workflows as well as enhance the customer experience.

## Why should I choose Dynamic Programming Solutions?

Instead of working with pre-built or off-the-shelf systems, we specialize in creating tailored systems that precisely match the customer’s need. Pre-built systems force the customer to settle for something that is partially right for their application but likely has shortcomings.

When you start with a custom solution from the beginning, you get exactly the functionality you want and any further development as your business grows is much smoother and simpler.

## What industries do you serve?

We work in diverse industries – healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, e-commerce, professional services, nonprofit and more. We are capable of helping all types of businesses optimize their business processes.

## Who are your typical customers?

We work primarily with startups and small businesses. These are companies that can benefit the most from our services because they don’t typically have in-house IT departments or developers.

We help them get off on the right foot, building a strong foundation for their future. We streamline their critical workflows with technology solutions that that maximize their productivity and accelerate their growth.

## What platforms do you use?

We do the backend in Java, frontend in Javascript/HTML/CSS. We use Amazon Web Services extensively, especially for any management functions are done on that platform. If a customer has specific requests, such as software in PHP, we can accommodate them.

## How does the development process work?

Typically we speak with you to understand your business, specifications and expectations. We define the project, craft a solution and provide a firm quote and timeline.

If the project is complex, such as software that will likely take more than a month of development, we set multiple milestones. At each milestone we give you a working version of the software, adding features at each stage. You have an opportunity to test the software and provide feedback.

We’re able to make any adjustments you want to ensure the finished product performs exactly as you wish. Communication and transparency are priorities for us so you’ll always know how your project is progressing.

## Do you offer any support after a project is complete?

Yes, everything we do is turnkey. Any software or app we create comes with full installation and one year of ongoing support for bugs. Upon request, we can provide monthly pricing for continuous management and maintenance.

## How do you price your services?

Because every project is a custom job, we don’t have fixed price points. We determine what’s involved in the project and how long it will take to complete and then provide a price. You’ll always know what the final cost will be before we get started. We offer no-obligation quotes, so you can find out the price for your project without having to commit to using our services.

Once you agree to go forward on a project, we require a 50% deposit. The balance is due upon completion of the project.

## What’s the next step?

Let’s have a conversation. Contact us so we can chat about your project. We’ll answer all your questions and offer a strategy for moving forward.
